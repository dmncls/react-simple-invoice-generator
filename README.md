# React Simple Invoice Generator

I don't know react or npm or yarn. There are lots of warnings and errors.

This is how I get it running:

1. `npm install --force`
1. `yarn start`
1. Open browser at: http://localhost:3000

## Known bugs

* The `paymentInfo` fields are not passed through at start up from the initial invoice data
* The `items` from the initial invoice data are not displayed (but I think they are present in the state)
* There is no way to reset the page back to the initial invoice data
